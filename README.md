# Project Overview

This project is a Power BI dashboard analyzing café sales data for a fictional café called Caffeine Collective. It highlights key business metrics such as total sales, transaction patterns, top-selling drinks, and payment method trends. The dashboard was designed with a café-owner and their employees in mind, focusing on clarity, storytelling, and interactivity.

- Provide café owner and café employees with an interactive tool to filter sales by drink type, date, and payment method.

# Features
